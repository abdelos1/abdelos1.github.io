I'm a **undergraduate student** at University of Abomey Calavi in Benin. I'm studiying physics at the Institut de Math√©matiques et de Sciences Physiques. I'm interessed by aerospace enginering that as fascinated me since starting my secondary school.
I developed a certain curiosity for understanding things around me and that curiosity led me to my passion for electronics that are used everywhere
